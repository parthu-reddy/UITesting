Existing retained-delivered Happy branch invocation1 passes1/1 (23.304s),0failures/errors/skips. Rendered receipt and rider trip agree with actual admin money: CARD/SUCCESS,total₹72.81,food₹46.67,GST₹2.34,delivery₹18.80,platform₹5.00,restaurant net₹34.67,rider net₹21.16. All18 ledger lines balance; exact restaurant/rider posted payouts match. No refund exists and no refund request was submitted. Selected-item partial quote matches visible Items+GST, retains its context and enables the final request button without clicking it. Evidence56 preserves counts/numbers and the no-new-order result.

Existing delivered read-only batch invocation1 passes2/2: CustomerSettings unrated dialog requires at least three target groups, its unrated submit stays disabled and no review POST occurs (11.608s); PartnerReadOnly exact rider trip shows the owned outlet, Delivered/date and positive payout (6.045s). Evidence57 retains both independent counts. They reuse60631296; no new checkout, review or refund write.

Existing OrderReviewsFlowTest#participantsReviewEachOther invocation1 is running on that same owned delivered order after the no-rating guard. It intentionally writes four dummy participant reviews through real UI and then verifies submitted targets read-only; old direct aggregate/cache methods remain disabled/deferred. Remaining: read-only settings/partner screens, restaurant earnings/statement/navigation/admin-money, final O4/O5 gates on UI509d084, metrics and final docs/checklists. Stop after O4/O5.
