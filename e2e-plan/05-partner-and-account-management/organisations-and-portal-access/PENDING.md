# Pending — 2026-10-03T17:36:31+05:30

- O1 actual live lifecycle1/0/0/0 and exact owner/published-outbox SQL verified in checkpoint36.
- Finish selected tracing and Notification codec config rollout; verify clean logs and no image drift.
- Record actual server latency and circuit-breaker IDs; absent series are not passing measurements.
- O2+ not started. All five product defaults confirmed. Scoped commits/pushes/publish/deploy and
  clean-deploy --wipe + fresh seed authorized when plan requires it. No wipe executed.
- Full nonzero earnings and Ads activation/serving remain open; later plan phases own these flows.

Current 2026-10-03T18:28:21+05:30: historical O2-not-started and notification-publishing entries are superseded. Finish local O2 clean suites, contracts, UI checks and deliberate break guards; add/compile required E2E. Then publish Common and all affected services/config/UI, authorized clean --wipe+freshseed, run real O2 and regression gates, exact ownership SQL and latency/breaker measurements. No wipe has occurred.

## Local batch 2026-10-03T18:37:44+05:30

Current 2026-10-03T18:37:44+05:30: O2 is implemented in local working source across restaurant ownership/permissions, shared money access, order/review access, outlet-entity chat, deterministic seeds and existing UI flows. Static gate13/13; shared clean251, Customer clean467 and Reviews clean95 (zero failures/errors/skips). Real role/query/stock/Feign/chat guards passed; actual PostgreSQL ownership migration guard1/0/0/0 passed in an isolated disposable schema, not an Oracle application. UI role guards21/0/0/0, typecheck/lint passed. New O2 E2E class compiles only, no new live fixture. Remaining gates: final clean consumers/contracts, required break-tests, full UI suite/build, O2 preflight runner, publishing, authorised fresh Dev wipe/reseed, Oracle staff/lifecycle/chat/financial regressions and carried membership latency/breaker measurements. O2 remains unpublished/undeployed; no wipe has run. O3+ remains unstarted. Full platform production readiness is incomplete.

See E2E checkpoint37/evidence37-o2-local-progress.json for per-class report counts/timestamps. Restaurant and chat ownership migrations require the authorised fresh Dev wipe; neither has run on Oracle.


## Reviewed schema cleanup — 2026-10-03T19:52:33+05:30

Current 2026-10-03T19:52:33+05:30: reviewed Dev schema cleanup is local only. Twenty incremental SQL files in Common/Identity/Restaurant/Chat/Notification are consolidated into initial schemas; all four full schemas and Identity/Restaurant seeds execute in disposable PostgreSQL/PostGIS,13 additional constraints pass. Clean Common251, Restaurant91, Chat73, Notification43 have zero failures/errors/skips; Identity clean99/0/0/3, plus all3 conditional rate guards3/0/0/0 separately. Schema integration guards1/0/0/0 each; O1 static20/20,O2 static13/13. Current O2 safe brand summary/final consumers/specs/UI build and existing baseline findings remain open. Publish Common/stubs then clean dependent images/UI before full authorised Dev --wipe, seed and public-Oracle live gates. No cleanup release/wipe occurred. O3+ wallet/Ads phases unstarted; full platform production readiness incomplete.

## Release preparation — 2026-10-03T20:21:43+05:30

Current 2026-10-03T20:21:43+05:30: CommonLibrary O2 commit37f68545a8293d42c9837c290d7bd62cfd673105 is published by GitHub Packages run37130225264 (success). Safe BrandSummaryDto prevents member brand lists/events from exposing tax/bank application data; HTTP privacy and actual OpenAPI guards2/0/0/0 pass. Final clean Customer472, Reviews96 and Gateway27 have zero failures/errors/skips before the full dependency rebuild now running. UI full125files/785tests passed; subsequent corrected brand3tests, typecheck and lint pass. Earlier concurrent API regeneration caused23 import failures and is preserved as a failed invocation. Core56/56, readiness61/61 static checks (one optional execution check skipped; UI independently executed), core16 and readiness10 positive/broken guard controls pass. Scoped hash-bound Dev schema recreation manifest protects unreviewed SQL and expires on production declaration. Full fleet clean artifacts/contracts are underway; O2 service/UI publication, authorised full --wipe/fresh seed and Oracle live gates remain pending. Oracle currently healthy; no wipe/new O2 live fixture. O3+ unstarted; full platform incomplete.

See checkpoint39 and evidence39 for exact proof and continuation.

### 2026-10-03T20:27:21+05:30 — Full graph verification

Pass1 clean install/package completed for all modules;15stub jars each contain contract resources. Privacy mutation actual HTTP guard1failure, source restored. First pass2 failed IdentitySigning8/1/0/0 because the parent test-only secret overrides the environment fixture; dependent modules skipped, not verified. Fixture isolation restored8/0/0/0 without runtime changes; full pass2 is rerunning. E2E test-compile passed; public Oracle tunnel HTTP200. No images/deploy/wipe executed.


## 2026-10-03T20:55:30+05:30 — O2 final local privacy release

Payout bank disclosure is fixed by PAYOUTS_MANAGE filtering on the mapped response, preserving earnings amounts and entity snapshots. Focused restored3 and full clean Ledger223 tests pass with0failures/errors/skips. Source0aca2ee pushed; exact latest stub publication is dispatched before consumer CI. UI final component build passed; full phase3 is running, phase4/5 pending. O2 static13/13, core56/56 pass. No new O2 image/deployment/wipe/live fixture yet; full platform remains incomplete.
